A question for our readers:

Let's say for sake of argument (I know some people have strong feelings about this) that a sandwich is some sort of filling between two exterior carb-based outer layers. With this in mind, is an open-faced sandwich still a sandwich? It doesn't fit the definition, but we still call it a sandwich.

(My vote is for no, but we'll let you all come to your own conclusions.)

Similarly, if we say that a bomber jacket is a cropped, zip-front jacket with elastic, ribbed waist and cuffs, is The Arrivals' Häver Modern Bomber still a bomber jacket? Maybe, maybe not. It’s certainly a little off the beaten path though.

Apparently, there's quite a span of difference between the modern and the traditional, at least in this case. The Arrivals have updated a staple jacket with a number of changes ranging from major to subtle. Let’s start big and then go small, shall we?

The most obvious change at a glance, and the one I alluded to earlier, is the choice of a shirttail hem in the Häver instead of the traditional ribbing. This leads to a pretty substantial difference in the silhouette of the jacket. The Häver is a lot slimmer, and a lot more form-fitting without the "poofiness" caused by the elastic ribbing of a more substantial, traditional bomber. This makes for quite a different shape than an MA-1, despite the fact that they're both bomber jackets. 

Upon closer inspection, though we can see the second in major modern touches: the texture. Rather than a smooth nylon or leather, the Häver (or, at least, the Häver in black) is made of a rubber-backed Italian twill. Instead of that shiny exterior you see on a lot of traditional, military-inspired bomber jackets, the twill is very much a matte black. Not only that though, it also creates a diagonal grain that’s visible from a few feet away.

Aside from these two significant departures, we have a few subtle details that also add to the design. One touch I love is the single visible button near the top of the zip that fastens the interior placket. It adds a nice bit of visual interest and asymmetry. Scattered throughout the jacket are a few eyelets for ventilation which add a bit of pop as well. The interior placket has a bit of a diagonal zig zag pattern on them too. The RiRi 2-way zip (lovingly dubbed the “Rolls Royce of fucking zippers” by Rob Garcia of En Noir) comes with some very nice leather pull tabs.

As it turns out, these details actually make a pretty big difference. This is an entirely black jacket. A lot of the time, you can add interest or break up an outfit with color or prints, but in the case of monochromatic pieces, you have to depend a lot more on shapes and textures. Between the details, different ways of zipping, the texture of the twill, and the shape of jacket’s hem and half-placket, there’s plenty of interest here.

However, despite how much I love the details, I found myself wondering for a while whether or not I should have bought something more like a standard MA-1. I’ve found that the Häver doesn’t quite fit the same gap in my wardrobe. As much as I love how it looks unzipped or half-unzipped from the bottom, I’m not a huge fan of how it looks when zipped fully. It doesn’t quite have as substantial a silhouette when zipped as would a bomber with a ribbed hem. This can be something of an issue on cold Chicago days. There are other times, as well, when I would wish that it were more of a cropped length.

Yet, once I learned to stop expecting this jacket to play the exact same role as a traditional bomber, I’ve come to love the Häver. It’s certainly a reasonably unique piece, and the jacket simply feels luxurious in the hand. I’ve been wearing it on and off for a couple of months now, and literally my only gripe is that the rubberized coating on some of the buttons have started to come off, revealing the shiny plastic underneath. I’m a pretty satisfied customer, and I’m definitely looking forward to The Arrivals’ future collections.

That being said, though, I might end up having to buy a more classic bomber jacket. Having to buy more clothes? What a shame.
