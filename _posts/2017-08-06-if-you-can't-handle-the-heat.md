##IF YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE HEAT ...
#### Jason Zhao, 06 August 2017


Until now, the furthest south I've ever lived is Chicago.

I was surprised the first time that I was called a northerner here in Texas. As a kid, 'up north' didn't start until Michigan's upper peninsula. But in retrospect I'm obviously not a southerner, and people are always so excited to tell me what's different down here.

So, in my short time here I've gotten to get a better sense about all the special southern things I've come to expect:

1.	CLAIM: People are nicer in the south. 
Maybe.
I mean, they’re nice. I don’t know if they’re noticeably nicer. It's true that I've been able to chat up random people in coffee shops or just on the sidewalk but a bunch of those people were from California or even Evanston.

2.	CLAIM: Barbecue is better here.
Maybe.
I have had only two barbecue experiences in my 7 weeks here. Salt lick? Bad. Way worse than, say, Green St. Smoked Meats in Chicago. Micklethwait’s? Pretty good, and there was free beer too. Would recommend.
For those of you keeping track at home, I rigorously inquired, and the t-stat from a n=2 regression of Austin on barbecue quality is -0.412. Not exactly decisive.

3.	CLAIM: It’s hot. You think you know what hot is, but you don’t. You are weak, like a child or a maybe some sort of rodent.
Oh God, yes. Definitely. 

I’ve learned a couple of things dealing with the heat here, but chief among them:
###I don't know how to look good in shorts.
 
Now obviously, it's not like I've never worn shorts before living in Chicago or Seattle or wherever, but it didn't really sink in until I began to think about the possibility of living here and realizing that it would be in the 80s for most of the year.  Shorts and tees would no longer be a necessary evil to muddle through for a couple of months, but a yearlong staple.  It's time to put some effort into my summer wardrobe.

So, I've looked around the internet to see what the fashion forums like to wear with shorts. And aside from the truly avant garde stuff ...

There's a lot of Childish Gambino.

Like, a lot.

Lots of floral and unbuttoned shirts over tees, and a lot of "inspiration albums" end up just being attractive people in simple outfits.

So in a recent effort to not be conspicuously lazy in the warmer months, I've tried a few different things, but it's been hard to maintain my aesthetic of "what if circa 2014 ~Scandinavian minimalism~ but forever".  For whatever reason, I have a hard time shaking the association of shorts as either ivy league prep, lazy or juvenile. But you grow from trying new things, and fashion is, I think, all about play (as is [mathematics](https://mathyawp.wordpress.com/2017/01/08/mathematics-for-human-flourishing/), apparently). Here are some things I've been playing at:

1. Color and patterns.
	One time a good friend of mine made a "Jason Zhao starter pack". It was a jpg of a black square. Clearly there is room for me to experiment with colors and patterns, especially since I've lost the option of playing with layering. I've gone out and bought a few of those patterned short sleeve button-ups, but in blacks and navys because change is terrifying, and am considering some patterned shorts as well. 
	Often, though, I let my shoes do the talking. Summer has been a great time to get some mileage out of my new favorite pair of shoes, the Common Projects Achilles Low in blush -- an eye-catching, but not garish, pastel pink. As a bonus, wearing an incredibly hyped up sneaker brand signals to snootier boutique shops that I actually am a serious customer and yes I do want a free beer while I browse.

2. Texture
	 I've been trying in general to think more about how the textures of different fabrics interact with each other, and I've also been very thankful that linen can both be very fun to work with and very conducive to surviving in the Texas sun. I've also picked up some subtle twists on basic summer staples like the Niels Bubble Tee from Norse Projects.

3.  Giving up completely and applying to jobs in colder climates.	 
	This one is my favorite so far.
