### Submission Instructions
* Create a markdown file with the contents of your post, and save it in `_posts` with the title formatted `YYYY-MM-DD-[title].markdown`. Be sure to include:
  - a title
  - a subtitle
  - a date
  - a category (style, beauty, or life)
  - a color, in hex	
  - tags

* Put your photos in `img/YYYY-MM-DD`. Be sure to include:
  - a short, wide photo with the title `00-featurecover.jpg`
  - a square photo with the title `0-cover.jpg`
  - any other photos you would like to be included with your post

*Consider [optimizing your photos for web](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/optimizing-content-efficiency/image-optimization?hl=en#optimizing-raster-images)--especially cover photos.*

See existing posts for examples. 

Due to our naming conventions, here cannot be more than one post per day. This may be changed eventually, but for now there's not enough publishing traffic to warrant such a change. If someone has already submitted a post for today, wait until tomorrow.
